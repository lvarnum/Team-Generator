# Team Generator

## Project Description  
The team generator application prompts a user to enter the details of the employees on their team. The team should have a manager, interns and engineers. Each employee has a name, employee id and email. Engineers will have their Github username, interns will have their school name and managers will have their office number. Once the user has finished entering employees, a team webpage will be rendered.



## Instructions for use
Follow the command line prompts starting with whether or not you would like to enter an employee. Enter all required employee information, you will be asked if you want to enter another employee after each round of questions. When you select that you would no longer like to enter employee information, the page will render. You can view your team's dashboard on the team.html page.
